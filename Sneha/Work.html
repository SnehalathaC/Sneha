        <p><h3><strong>Company Name: Omega Shipping Agency pvt.LTd, 2nd floor, Vinayaka Complex, Domluru, Bangalore, Karnataka</strong></h3></p>
        <p>On 2nd May, 2023 I and Pavan went to office and suddenly there was 
        <p style="color:rgb(249, 4, 110)">
            <strong>Mr. Clarence Xavier sir.</strong>
        </p> He took to his cabin and asked us "whether you want to work together as a team or do you want to do individual projects"
        We answered him that we want to do the project as a team. Then he explained about the project of <strong>"EMPLOYEE BILL REIMBURSEMENT" </strong> and introduced us to his staff.
       There are 6 members in that office, they are Mr. Pramod, Mr. Stanley, Mrs. Meenakshi, Mrs. Meena, Mr. Kishore, and Mr. Varun except me and pavan. 
       Everyone are elders to us and Mr. Varun is 1 year older than us. Those people are totally work alcoholics, but they care of us. 
        </p>
        <p>
       We didn't got to know how to start the project, after a week we started to do the project by creating Login page and gave review to Clarence sir.
      After that we started to watch more vedios on HTML and CSS.</p>
      <p style="color: rgb(5, 156, 249);">We used <strong style="color: red;">"Tailwind.css"</strong> to do all the frontend part. </p>
      <p>We took a long time to finish the project because lack of experience. In the frontend part we created:</p>
      <p style="color: #666524;"><strong>1. Login Page <br> <br>2. New  Bill Request form <br> <br>3. Manager Page (to approve or reject the new request of the employee) <br> <br>4. Accountant Page (to reimburse the approved bill from the Manager)</strong></p>
      <h3 style="text-align: center;">Total Project:</h3>
      <p>Employee Id and Password will be there to login whether it is employee or manager or accountant.</p>
      <p>If the <strong>employee</strong> will login then, it shows their previous bill request status and also at the top of the page he can see <strong>NEW REQUEST FORM</strong></p>
      <p>If the <strong>manager</strong> will login then, they can see the new bill requests of the employee's and also his bill request status, because he is also an employee. If he opens any bill request he can see two options below the <strong>VIEW BILL </strong>option. They are <strong>Approve</strong> or <strong>Reject</strong>. He can reject or approve the bill.</p>
      <p>If the <strong>accountant</strong> will login then, they can see the approved bills from the manager. If he opens the approved bill request, they can reimburse the approved bill request with the details of employee bill request. Accountant also have an option of bill request. </p>
      <h3 style="text-align: center;"> <strong>..........................This is the end of the <strong>frontend part</strong>..........................</strong></h>
      <p><h4>Backend:</h4></p>
      <p>In the backend part we totally used <strong>"MY SQL"</strong>. We created to a table for <strong>Employee, Manager,</strong> and <strong>Accountant</strong> names, ID, and Passwords for the login page.</p>
      <p>Another page is also created for the <strong>NEW REQUEST FORM</strong>. We included expense details, date of the bill request, to upload image of the bill or transaction ID screenshot (as a proof).</p>
      <p>As for the remaining we connected every page together.</p>
      <h3 style="text-align: center;">..........................This is the end of the <strong>Project</strong>..........................</strong></h3>
      <p>On <strong>22/06/2023</strong> i.e., Thrusday, we succesffuly completed our project and also recieved <strong>experience letter (certificate)</strong> from <strong style="color: rgb(249, 4, 110);">Clarence sir</strong>.</p>
